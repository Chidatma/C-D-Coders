# Mangrove Watch – Community Monitoring

**Mangrove Watch** is an interactive platform that allows communities to report incidents involving mangroves, such as illegal cutting, pollution, or land reclamation. It uses geotagging, AI-assisted validation, and gamification techniques to empower communities to take action for coastal conservation.

This platform stores data locally in the browser, and provides a simple, user-friendly interface to report, validate, and track the state of mangrove ecosystems.
